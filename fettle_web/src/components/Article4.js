                <h1>Understanding the Relation Between Hydration and Mental Health</h1>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    Good health is all about maintaining a balance between physical health,
                    emotional health, mental health and social health. There are many things
                    you do to ensure that you remain in good health. One of these is the
                    simplest thing you can do and yet itâ€™s the one that is most often
                    overlooked or neglected. You may not know but your mineral water intake
                    has a huge impact on your mental health. If you are dehydrated, it will
                    have a negative impact on your mood and thinking while staying hydrated
                    can be an instant mood-lifter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ways in Which Hydration Improves Mental Health</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relaxes Your Mind</li>
                    <p>
                        If you ever feel relaxed or anxious or nervous, sipping on water can
                        have an almost immediate effect and can calm you down. Studies have
                        shown that dehydration has a negative effect on your mind since it is
                        not being provided with enough oxygen. As soon as you start hydrating
                        your body with mineral water, you will notice your mind feeling so much
                        more at peace and at ease.
                    </p>
                    <li>Improves Your Mood</li>
                    <p>
                        You may enjoy the energy boost that caffeine gives you but if you want
                        something to boost your mood, there is nothing like a glass of mineral
                        water to do the trick. The effect is almost instantaneous. Whether you
                        are feeling sad, angry, irritated or gloomy, just drink some water and
                        watch how your mood changes for the better!
                    </p>
                    <li>Helps You Focus and Concentrate</li>
                    <p>
                        Have you ever noticed that sometimes your mind feels fuzzy and like you
                        cannot correctly string your thoughts together or that you cannot seem
                        to focus long enough on the topic at hand? This is your brain telling
                        you that you are dehydrated. Drinking water also helps with improving
                        your focus and attention span. Since you are providing the brain with
                        adequate levels of oxygen, it is going to help you think clearly,
                        improve your focus and maximize your performance.
                    </p>
                    <li>Boosts Brain Power</li>
                    <p>
                        While drinking water increases your attention span, it also makes you
                        feel mentally energised and ready to blaze through the to-do list for
                        the day. If you are ever feeling mentally drained, drinking mineral
                        water can give it the push that it needs to ensure that it is working at
                        its best.
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To ensure good mental health, you need to remind yourself to keep drinking
                    water. While it is easier to remind yourself to stay hydrated when at
                    home, when you are outdoors and running errands, it can easily miss your
                    notice. If you are not carrying a bottle with you, you can purchase a
                    bottle of Fettle water that will ensure you nourish your mind and body.
                    Stay healthy and stay hydrated!
