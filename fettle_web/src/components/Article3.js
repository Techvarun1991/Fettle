                <h1>5 Reasons Why Your Skin Needs to Stay Hydrated</h1>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    We all know that staying hydrated is imperative for our body to function
                    properly and maintain good health. But staying hydrated is also essential
                    if you want to have glowing, clear skin. It is drinking mineral water that
                    is going to prove very beneficial for your skin in the long run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reasons To Stay Hydrated</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prevents Premature Aging</li>
                    <p>
                        Want to continue looking young for a long time to come? Drink water! The
                        key to having younger looking skin lies in those 3-4 liters of water
                        that you need to drink every day. Keeping yourself hydrated keeps the
                        skin moisturized for a long time and increases the elasticity. This
                        delays sagging of the skin so fine lines and wrinkles take a long time
                        to take form!
                    </p>
                    <li>It Gets Your Skin to Glow</li>
                    <p>
                        When you drink enough water every day, your skin gets hydrated and
                        moisturized. This helps to keep it smooth and supple. With skin so
                        smooth and moisturized, it will have a radiant glow. When sunlight
                        touches your skin, it will bounce off your smooth skin and give it that
                        gorgeous dewy look, which would not be possible if your skin was rough,
                        dull and dry. If you want that natural glow, drink some mineral water.

                    <li>It Prevents Acne</li>
                    <p>
                        In the hustle-bustle of our fast-paced lives, we are forgetting to give
                        our body the attention and care it deserves. Dehydration, pollution and
                        unhealthy diet are some of the reasons that are leaving a negative
                        impact on our skin. While acne is a common skin dilemma in our teenage
                        years, more and more adults are reporting cases of mild or acute acne.
                        One of the biggest advantages of drinking water is that it is a great
                        cure for reducing acne and clearing your skin. Drinking water helps to
                        balance the oil and water content on your face’s skin. This helps to
                        prevent excess oil and sebum secretion, hence fewer clogged pores and
                        acne.

                    <li>It Reduces Wrinkles</li>
                    <p>
                        Drinking enough mineral water will ensure that your skin looks smooth
                        and tight. Since your skin is adequately hydrated, the elasticity will
                        be maintained and Water keeps your body hydrated and refreshed and helps
                        maintain your skin’s elasticity. People who drink large amounts of water
                        are less likely to develop wrinkles and scars. Hence, keeping sagging
                        skin at bay for a long time to come!

                    <li>It Maintains pH Balance</li>
                    <p>
                        Whether your skin is far too oily or far too dry, one of the best
                        solutions to rectify that is drinking enough water. Sensitive,
                        acne-ridden skin or any other skin problem can be treated by correcting
                        the pH balance of your skin by drinking enough water. Be consistent in
                        your water intake and you will start noticing the positive difference in
                        a few days!

                        <strong>Conclusion</strong>

                    <p>
                        While you can consume water in different ways (green tea, lemon water,
                        etc.), there is nothing better than just plain mineral water. Especially
                        when you are out and about, you must always carry a bottle of water so
                        that you can meet your daily target of water consumed. If you have to
                        buy a bottle of water, nothing better than Fettle where the potassium
                        and magnesium-rich water goes through a 10-step purification process
                        &amp; 114 Quality Tests before being bottled. Now you can always stay
                        healthy and hydrated!
